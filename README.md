# Advent of Code Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of programming
puzzles published by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). This repository contains my
solutions for the years I've participated in.

Some people compete to answer the problems as quickly as possible. Others
challenge themselves to write solutions that are optimal in some sense
(shortest, fastest, etc.). I'm using AoC as an opportunity to learn new
languages or make myself more proficient in ones I have limited experience
with. So far I've done

* 2018: Go
* 2019: C++
* 2020: Javascript
* 2021: Rust
